# Recipe CRUD API Project

This is a simple backend project to manage recipes using Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB.  
I followed the MVC pattern and tested all the API routes using Postman.

## Technologies Used

- Node.js
- Express.js
- MongoDB (Mongoose)
- Postman (for API testing)

## Features

1. Create a recipe  
2. Get all recipes  
3. Get a recipe by ID  
4. Update a recipe by ID  
5. Delete a recipe by ID  

## Folder Structure

- models → MongoDB schema file (recipeModels.js)  
- controllers → Functions for each API (recipeController.js)  
- routes → All API routes (recipeRoutes.js)  
- config → MongoDB connection (db.js)  
- app.js → Main server file  
- .env → Mongo URI and port  

## How to Run

1. Install dependencies:  
   `npm install`

2. Create `.env` file: 
    adding the URI and PORT number

3. Start the server:  
`npm start`

## API Endpoints

POST => /api/recipes =>  Create new recipe    
GET => /api/recipes =>  Get all recipes      
GET => /api/recipes/:id => Get recipe by ID     
PUT => /api/recipes/:id =>  Update recipe by ID  
DELETE => /api/recipes/:id => Delete recipe by ID  

## Postman

I created and tested all APIs in Postman.  
Imported the collection and included the JSON file in this folder.
